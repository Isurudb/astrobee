# sequence ID: consecutively increasing ID 
uint32 seq
#Two-integer timestamp that is expressed as:
# * stamp.sec: seconds (stamp_secs) since epoch (in Python the variable is called 'secs')
# * stamp.nsec: nanoseconds since stamp_secs (in Python the variable is called 'nsecs')

# The stamp should store the time at which this goal was requested.
# It is used by an action server when it tries to preempt all
# goals that were requested before a certain time
time stamp

# The id provides a way to associate feedback and
# result message with specific goal requests. The id
